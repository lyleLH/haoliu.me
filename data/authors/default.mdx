## Hi there <Twemoji emoji="waving-hand" />

I'm **Hao Liu**, a software engineer from **Vancouver, Canada**. I enjoy building applications. I work mainly with **Swift**, **UIKit**. I have strong background in iOS Architecture design.

And I'm proficient with cross-platform technologies like **Dart**, **Flutter** and **ReactNative** .

I'm a **Mobile Lead** of iOS and Android team, and I'm familiar with agile development and agile management.

I started this blog as a way to document and share stuff I have learned and found useful as a software engineer. Building and writing things down is a great way for me to solidify my understanding of new concepts and ideas. I hope my blog could be a helpful resource for fellow devs who interested in web dev, and related technologies.

I would be highly appreciated if you could leave your comments and thoughts on what I have written <Twemoji emoji="clinking-beer-mugs" />.
