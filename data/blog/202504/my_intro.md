Hello, I'm Hao Liu, a senior iOS developer with over 9 years of experience specializing in iOS architecture design, particularly VIPER and MVVM patterns.

I've worked with various companies like REVERY AI, YEAHKA LIMITED, and Chinasoft International, where I've contributed to developing successful mobile applications using Swift, Objective-C, and UIKit.

My technical expertise extends beyond iOS development to include Flutter, Node.js, TypeScript, and various modern frameworks.

From April 2023 to April 2024, I worked as a Senior iOS Developer at REVERY AI.

It's a fully remote position, where I lead the development of the Reverie app.

REVERY AI is startup based in SF, invested by YCombinator in 2023.

The Reverie app is a mobile application I developed using Swift and UIKit. As part of the development team, I am responsiable for implementing key features, maintaining and improving the app's architecture, and enhancing codebase quality.

I collaborated closely with design and product teams using tools like Slack, Asana, and Figma to ensure seamless coordination throughout the development process.

I've successfully launched personal projects including ixHush, a white noise mixer application, I also provided some audio source that I generated using AI. User can use it to get better sleep or focus and meditation.

Another one is a Creation Canvas App, named MoE Card. I highly recommend this app to you or your child, I also adapted it to iPad.

These two apps can demonstrate my ability to take projects from 0 to 1.

Throughout my career, I've held leadership positions where I've managed dependencies using Cocoapods and Fastlane, built CI/CD pipeline, core infrastructure components, and led development teams.

I'm passionate about creating efficient, user-friendly applications and constantly expanding my technical knowledge. I'm looking forward to bringing my skills and experience to new challenges in mobile development.
